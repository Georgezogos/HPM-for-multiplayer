# HPM for multiplayer
 This is a mod for the game Victoria II, based on HPM
 
 Just copy the HPM-multi folder and the HPM-multi.mod to the mod folder and you're good to go.
 
 DISCLAIMER : This mod exists for use in a specific discord server. If you were not sent from there then you should probably not download this.
 
 Seeing that there is no licence on the original HPM, I decided to make this repo public, but wih any request from the original devs, I will take it down.
 
 Current features:
   - The ability to request/give financial aid from/to other players
   - The ability to transfer a state/province to other players
   - Divergence of Darkness-like infamy reduction for early game
   - Larger assimilation scale
